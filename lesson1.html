        What is programming?
        <section>
          <h2>What programming isn't</h2>
          <p>Unfortunately programming doesn’t do anything for you on its own.</p>
          <p>Every piece of functionality on every computer - from the operating system all the way up to this page being drawn from HTML have all been enabled by someone writing that functionality.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>What programming is</h2>
          <p>Programming or software development is essentially <strong>writing the general solution to a problem</strong> in a <strong>strongly structured and limited set of keywords</strong>.</p>
          <p>So programming doesn’t solve your problems for you, it enables you to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use a computer to do the brainwork that you don’t want to do yourself.</li>
            <li>Automate tasks that you can figure out the solution to.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Whiteboard exercise:</p>
          <p>Imagine a person who has no idea how anything works, but can carry out basic instructions.</p>
          <br />
          <p>How would you tell them how to make a cup of tea?</p>

        Pseudocode
        <section>
          <p>Pseudocode is an almost-bridge between normal English statements and a fully functional programming language.</p>
          <p>It’s a way of expressing the logic you want to achieve without having to go straight into writing code.</p>
          <p>It doesn’t have a set syntax (defined structure) but does have the key components of most programming languages.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>In order to describe solutions to problems, most programming languages provide the following functionality at a minimum:</p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        Variables
        <section>
          <p>Variables are for storing values we can refer to and update in our program.</p>
          <pre><code class="nohighlight">set *variableName* to *variableValue*</code></pre>
          <pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
set myAge to 24
set legalDrinkingAge to 18
if (myAge is greater than or equal to legalDrinkingAge)
  I can drink
else
  I cannot drink
          </code></pre>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        if-statements
        <section>
          <p>if-statements give us <strong>conditional execution</strong> in our code.</p>
          <p>This enables us to change the program's behavior based on true/false assertions.</p>
          <pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
if (*some condition*)
  *thing to do if true*
else
  *thing to do if false
        </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
if (today is Friday)
  send a team lunch invitation in outlook
          </code></pre>
          <p>an 'else' clause can be added, which is done if the condition is false:</p>
          <pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
if (it is the morning and it is the weekend)
  stay at home and do nothing
else
  go to work
        </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Conditions can be chained, if you need more than 2 paths:</p>
          <pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
set user to super user
if (user is super user)
  user can do anything
else if (user is admin)
  user can do admin tasks
else
  user has no special permissions
        </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Whiteboard Exercise</h2>
          <p>Write pseudocode for the following:</p>
          <blockquote>If Captain Obvious is happy, all customers get a 15% discount. Otherwise, no discounts are available.</blockquote>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        for-loops
        <section>
          <p>For loops enable you to do something multiple times, there are 2 varieties:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>for each</li>
            <li>for with counter</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>for each</h2>
          <p>Essentially "Do something for each thing in some collection".</p>
          <pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
for (each item in a collection)
  *do something with each item
          </code></pre>
          <pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
for (each day of the month)
  display the day, weekday, and events on the day
        </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Whiteboard Exercise</h2>
          <p>Write pseudocode for the following:</p>
          <blockquote>A hotel wants confirmation of all the bookings over the next week. Print each booking number from the list <code>thisWeekBookings</code>.</blockquote>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>for with counter</h2>
          <p>Gives you a counter you can use for whatever you want. You can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Start at any value</li>
            <li>End at any value</li>
            <li>Increment by any value (even downward)</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>for with counter</h2>
          <pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
for (counter from *lowerBound* to *upperBound*)
  *do something for each value in the range
          </code></pre>
          <p>or with a different increment/step</p>
          <pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
for (counter from *lowerBound* to *upperBound*, step *stepValue*)
  *do something for each value in the range, at the given stepValue
        </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>for with counter</h2>
          <pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
set weekDays to [Monday,  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday]
for (counter from 1 to 7)
  print the counter, next to to it also print weekDays[counter]
          </code></pre>
          <p>Here <code>weekDays[counter]</code> represents the weekday in the counter'th position</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Whiteboard Exercise</h2>
          <p>Write pseudocode for the following:</p>
          <blockquote>Happy Hotel has 38 rooms. The hotel manager wants a list of room numbers printed out to give to the cleaning staff.</blockquote>
          <p>Extension:</p>
          <blockquote>The hotel manager decides to cut down on costs. Print a list with every 2nd room number instead.</blockquote>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        while loop
        <section>
          <p>Do something a potentially infinite number of times</p>
          <p>The loop stops when the condition becomes true</p>
          <pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
while (*some condition*)
  * do something, for as many times as the condition stays true
          </code></pre>
          <pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
set counter to 0
while (counter is less than 10)
  print counter
  set counter to counter + 1
        </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Whiteboard Exercise</h2>
          <p>Write pseudocode for the following:</p>
          <blockquote>Hotels.com is running a giveaway competition and wants to give away as many prizes as possible with a $500,000 budget. Each prize costs $33.29. Keep giving away prizes until this budget has been used up.</blockquote>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        Examples
        <section>
          <p>For example, to decide whether to take out an umbrella today, I’d say</p>
          <blockquote>If it’s going to rain then I’d take my umbrella.</blockquote>
          <p>Which I can write in a more structured way as:</p>
          <pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
if (it is going to rain)
  bring my umbrella
else
  leave it at home
        </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Or to find someone’s name in an unsorted list, I’d say</p>
          <blockquote>Go through the list until I see the name I’m looking for</blockquote>
          <p>This is a bit harder to translate, but essentially I’m saying</p>
          <blockquote>I would check each item in the list, until I find the name or I’ve checked the entire list</blockquote>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Which I can now write as:</p>
          <pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
for (each name in the list)
  if (that name matches the one I'm looking for)
    the name is in the list
  else
    continue through the list

if (I go through the whole list without finding the name)
  the name is not in the list
        </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Or using a variable, as:</p>
          <pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
set isInTheList to false
for (each name in the list) do
  if (that name matches the one I'm looking for)
    set isInTheList to true
  else
    continue through the list

if (isInTheList is true)
  the name is in the list
else
  the name is not in the list
        </code></pre>
