					<h2>Lesson 1</h2>
					<p>Describing how to solve problems</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					Lesson Outcomes
					<section>
						<p>By The end of this lesson you should:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Understand how programming languages provide the tools to solve problems</li>
							<li>Be able to solve problems in a structured format known as pseudocode</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					What is programming?
					<section>
						<h2>What programming isn't</h2>
						<p>Unfortunately programming doesn’t do anything for you on its own.</p>
						<p>Every piece of functionality on every computer - from the operating system all the way up to this page being drawn from HTML have all been enabled by someone writing that functionality.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What programming is</h2>
						<p>Programming or software development is essentially <strong>writing the general solution to a problem</strong> in a <strong>strongly structured and limited set of keywords</strong>.</p>
						<p>So programming doesn’t solve your problems for you, it enables you to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Use a computer to do the brainwork that you don’t want to do yourself.</li>
							<li>Automate tasks that you can figure out the solution to.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>An Exercise:</p>
						<p>Imagine a person who has no idea how anything works, but can carry out basic instructions.</p>
						<br/>
						<p>How would you tell them how to make a cup of tea?</p>
						<small>Write down your instructions, we’ll make use of these later.</small>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Pseudocode</h2>
						<p>Pseudocode is an almost-bridge between normal English statements and a fully functional programming language.</p>
						<p>It’s a way of expressing the logic you want to achieve without having to go straight into writing code.</p>
						<p>It doesn’t have a set syntax (defined structure) but does have the key components of most programming languages.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Pseudocode</h2>
						<p>In order to describe solutions to problems, most programming languages provide the following functionality at a minimum:</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Variables</h2>
					<p>Variables are for storing values we can refer to and update in our program.</p>
					<pre><code class="nohighlight">set *variableName* to *variableValue*</code></pre>
					<pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
						set myAge to 24
						set legalDrinkingAge to 18
						if (myAge is greater than or equal to legalDrinkingAge)
						  I can drink
						else
						  I cannot drink
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>if-statements</h2>
					<section>
						<p>if-statements give us <strong>conditional execution</strong> in our code.</p>
						<p>This enables us to change the program's behavior based on true/false assertions.</p>
						<pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
							if (*some condition*)
							  *thing to do if true*
							else
							  *thing to do if false
						</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
							if (today is Friday)
							  send a team lunch invitation in outlook
						</code></pre>
						<p>an 'else' clause can be added, which is done if the condition is false:</p>
						<pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
							if (it is the morning and it is the weekend)
							  stay at home and do nothing
							else
							  go to work
						</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Conditions can be chained, if you need more than 2 paths:</p>
						<pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
							set user to super user
							if (user is super user)
							  user can do anything
							else if (user is admin)
							  user can do admin tasks
							else
							  user has no special permissions
						</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Whiteboard Exercise</h2>
						<p>Write pseudocode for the following:</p>
						<blockquote>If Polly has been good, Santa will give her a toy. If Polly has been bad, Polly’s gift will be a lump of coal.</blockquote>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>for-loops</h2>
						<p>For loops enable you to do something multiple times, there are 2 varieties:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>for each</li>
							<li>for with counter</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>for each</h2>
						<p>Essentially "Do something for each thing in some collection".</p>
						<pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
							for (each item in a collection)
							  *do something with each item
						</code></pre>
						<pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
							for (each day of the month)
							  display the day, weekday, and events on the day
						</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Whiteboard Exercise</h2>
						<p>Write pseudocode for the following:</p>
						<blockquote>Write out a receipt for each item in Santa’s sack of presents.</blockquote>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>for with counter</h2>
						<p>Gives you a counter you can use for whatever you want. You can:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Start at any value</li>
							<li>End at any value</li>
							<li>Increment by any value (even downward)</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>for with counter</h2>
						<pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
							for (counter from *lowerBound* to *upperBound*)
							  *do something for each value in the range
						</code></pre>
						<p>or with a different increment/step</p>
						<pre><code data-trim class="nohighlight">
							for (counter from *lowerBound* to *upperBound*, step *stepValue*)
								*do something for each value in the range, at the given stepValue
						</code></pre>
