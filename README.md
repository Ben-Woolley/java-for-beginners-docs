# Who is this course aimed at?
Java 101 is aimed at **complete beginners to programming**. If you know:
* What a variable is
* What an if-statement is (aka conditionals)
* What a for-loop is
* Have written in any other programming language the above concepts

Then it's likely this course is too basic for you. This content is not designed for transitioning from another language.

# Learning Outcomes
This is an **introductory course to programming**. By the end of the course you should be able to:
* Read and understand what simple Java programs are achieving
* Create general solutions for programming problems, for example:
   * Calculating numbers based on user input
   * Finding the largest number in a list
   * Writing simple games

# Why should you learn programming?
Programming isn't just for writing big applications. In addition, the fundamentals in this course can transfer to other languages. 

The biggest advantage of programming for most people is **automation**, such as:
* Writing a script for your spreadsheet software that *performs a sequence of actions* you do frequently.
* Writing a small program to perform some action on a file like removing specific characters from each line. (the Python programming language is common for ad-hoc scripts)

With further learning, there's nothing stopping you from writing more complex software **built up from smaller modules** such as those built in this course.

No, they are different languages.  
Javascript's main use-case is enhancing websites in your web browser (known as front-end).
