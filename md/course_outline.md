# Course Outline
This is a high-level overview of the course, including links to the slides and recommended reading.

**It is highly recommended that you go through the slides before the session.**

The reading list is **optional but recommended**. They include alternative explanations for concepts, and additional examples.

## Useful Resources
These resources are particularly good and will be recommended throughout the course.
* [w3schools Java Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp) provideds a concise but detailed overview of Java's features page-by-page. The site even features simple exercises.
* [Programiz Learn Java Programming](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming) another good but more in-depth resource that we cherry-pick pages from for this course. These in general have more detail than w3schools.

## Session 1
Before you attend the first session, you should be ready to write, build, and run Java code.

We will be learning the base tools every programming language has using **psuedocode** - a half-way between natural language and programming languages.  

**This lesson will be delivered in lecture format, covering "Describing how to solve problems"**

**Actions:**
* Follow the [Developer Setup Guide](dev_setup.md)

**Slides:** 
* [Java 101 introduction](../lesson0.html)
* [Describing how to solve problems](../lesson1.html)

**Reading List:**
* [hackr.io blog - What is Programming?](https://hackr.io/blog/what-is-programming) (You don't need to do the "Writing your first program" section)
* [freeCodeCamp - What is Computer Programming? Defining Software Development.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-computer-programming-defining-software-development/)

## Session 2
We will now translate our knowledge of programming's base tools into Java.

**Slides:** [Java 101 - The basic building blocks of programming](../lesson2.html)

**Reading List:**
* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp)
   * [Hello World Explained](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_syntax.asp)
   * [Java Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_variables.asp) (This uses the old style of declaring variables)
   * [Data Types](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_data_types.asp)
   * [Operators (includine ones I have not covered)](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_operators.asp)
   * [A more detailed String tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_strings.asp)
   * [Booleans](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_booleans.asp)
   * [If-Statements (including a different form known as a ternary operator)](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_conditions.asp)


## Session 3
We'll extend the toolset we've seen so far in Java by adding **collections** and **loops** (aka iteration).

**Slides:** [Java 101 - The basic building blocks of programming part 2](../lesson2_2.html)

**Reading List:**
* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp)
    * [For-Loops](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_for_loop.asp)
    * [While-Loops](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_while_loop.asp) including Do-While, in which the code block is run at least once.
* [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/list) pages expanding on collections:
    * [Programiz - Java List](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/list)
    * [Programiz - Java Set](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/set)
    * [Programiz - Java Map](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/map)


## Sesson 4
We now come to one of Java's main features - **Object-Oriented** programming. 
This allows us to create **our own types** and give them functionality unique to them.

**Slides:** [Java 101 - Classes and Methods](../lesson3.html)

**Reading List:**
* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp)
   * [What is a class? What is an object?](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_oop.asp)
   * [Creating classes and objects](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_classes.asp)
* [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming)
    * [Java Class and Objects](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/class-objects) - a decent example of creating a class, creating instances, and using methods.
    * [Constructors](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/constructors) - a decent example of creating a class, creating instances, and using methods.
