# Course Outline
This is a high-level overview of the course, including links to the slides and recommended reading.

**It is highly recommended that you go through the slides before the session.**

The reading list is optional but recommended. They include alternative explanations for concepts, and additional examples.

## Session 1
Before you attend the first session, you should be ready to write, build, and run Java code.

We will be learning the base tools every programming language has using **psuedocode** - a half-way between natural language and programming languages. 
The slides covered in the session are [here](../lesson1.html).

**Actions:**
* Follow the [Developer Setup Guide](dev_setup.md)

**Slides:** [Java 101 introduction](../lesson0.html)

**Reading List:**
* [hackr.io blog - What is Programming?](https://hackr.io/blog/what-is-programming) (You don't need to do the "Writing your first program" section)
* [freeCodeCamp - What is Computer Programming? Defining Software Development.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-computer-programming-defining-software-development/)

## Session 2
We will now translate our knowledge of programming's base tools into Java.

**Slides:** [Java 101 - The basic building blocks of programming](../lesson2.html)

**Reading List:**
*

## Session 3
We'll extend the toolset we've seen so far in Java by adding **collections** and **loops** (aka iteration).

**Slides:** [Java 101 - The basic building blocks of programming part 2](../lesson2_2.html)

**Reading List:**
* 

## Sesson 4
We now come to one of Java's main features - **Object-Oriented** programming. 
This allows us to create **our own types** and give them functionality unique to them.

**Slides:** [Java 101 - Classes and Methods](../lesson2_2.html)

**Reading List:**
