        Welcome to Java for Beginners!
        <section>
          <p>This course is intended to be an introduction to <strong>programming that happens to be in Java</strong>.</p>
          <p>Many of the concepts you learn here are in the vast majority of programming languages out there; each one being a different tool for different jobs!</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>By the end of this course I hope you will have an awareness or understanding of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The fundamental concepts that programming languages feature</li>
            <li>Some basic object-oriented programming concepts</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>...and the ability to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Solve problems by "translating English into Java"</li>
            <li>Write small, interactive, multi-file Java programs</li>
          </ul>

        How do programs run on your computer?
        <section>
          <p>Computers understand a fundamental set of instructions.</p>
          <p class="fragment">These instructions are however very primitive and way too low-level for everyone to write programs in.</p>
          <p class="fragment">Programming languages sit on top of these primitive instructions and give us a more human-friendly set of tools.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>The world now has more programming languages than it knows what to do with - built not only on top of machine code but also on each other.</p>
          <p class="fragment">Each has it's own specialty or opinions that makes it the best for certain jobs, for example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment"><small><strong>C</strong> is a language written originally for building operating systems for computers. It exposes enough of the machine level to let clever people do magic, and dangerous people cause many more
                bugs.</small></li>
            <li class="fragment"><small><strong>R</strong> specializes in statistical computing</small></li>
            <li class="fragment"><small><strong>Python</strong> is a general-purpose language focusing on readability</small></li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>These languages end up running on computers in one of two ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment"><small>The program source code is <strong>compiled</strong> (aka translated) to machine-understandable code <strong>before it can be run</strong>.</small>
              <ul>
                <li><small>e.g. C, C++, Java*</small></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="fragment"><small>An <strong>interpreter</strong> runs the program that knows how to turn your source into machine-understandable code <strong>while it runs</strong>.</small>
              <ul>
                <li><small>e.g. Python, Java*</small></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="fragment">
            <p>Java actually does both!</p>
            <small>Java source is compiled to Java Virtual Machine (JVM) bytecode, which the JVM installed on supported machines can then interpret!</small>

        What is Java?
        <section>
          <p>Java is one of the most popular programming languages used today! It is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Object-oriented - You have objects of certain types, that have properties and ways to interact with those properties.</li>
            <li>Class-based - You define the blueprints for objects before you create them.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Java is designed to be runnable everywhere by use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>
          <p>The JVM is written to run on most machines, and Java is compiled (converted) to a language that runs on the JVM.</p>
          <p><strong>Write Once, Run Anywhere</strong> is one of the biggest advantages of Java.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Because Java is used everywhere, it's used for many things.</p>
          <p class="fragment">It is used across Expedia Group for most of the functionality of our websites.</p>
          <div class="fragment">
            <p>It has also been used to write:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="fragment">Simulations</li>
              <li class="fragment">Video games</li>
              <li class="fragment">Development tools (like the one we'll be using)</li>
              <li class="fragment">Android apps*</li>
            </ul>
            <small class="fragment">(*In a sense, they use the same language, but Android doesn't use the JVM)</small>

        Common pitfalls
        <section>
          <p>As with learning most things, we all make the same mistakes and assumptions, here's a list of what I've noticed while teaching this course.</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment"><strong>You can refer to the lesson material while doing exercises</strong> - it's not an exam, treat it like you're solving any problem.</li>
            <li class="fragment"><strong>Lines that don't end in a bracket of some sort must end with a semicolon</strong> - this is so Java knows the <Strong>expression</strong> you're writing is done.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Java is case sensitive</strong> - you must match the case and be consistent with your naming, otherwise your program will break!</li>
            <li class="fragment"><strong>Every open bracket, brace, and parenthesis must have a matching close</strong> - this is how Java knows what context something is happening in. If they're in the wrong place you're likely going to run into
              problems.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>If your program is in an unhappy state please ask for help!</strong> - It's much easier for us to fix something as soon as it goes wrong, rather than after you finish writing and it won't compile.</li>
            <li class="fragment"><strong>Coding is both a science and an art</strong> - There usually is more than one way of solving a problem. By all means consult with your fellow learners, but don't panic if their solutions are not the same as
              yours.</li>
          </ul>

        Setup

          <p>In this lesson we are going to get your machine ready for writing, compiling, and running Java programs.</p>
